# YT Analytics Project
 Data analytics project about 4 channels using youtube API 

 The goal of this project was to analyze the youtube channels and videos of 4 of the creators that I watch the most.
 The 4 channels belong to : Lex Friddman, Andrew Humberman, Chris Williamson and Alex Hormozi

 The data was acquired with the youtube API. After I was able to load it and transform it, I started analyzing the data and gathering insights with various visualizations in the EDA notebook.

 Afterwards, I loaded the xlxs files in Power Bi and I created a 2-page dashboard, where the user can find all the information and insights about these 4 channels.
